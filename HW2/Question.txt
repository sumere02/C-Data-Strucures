the weighted path length of a leaf to be its weight times its depth.

The least occurred characters inserted deeper in the tree compared to more occurred characters 
also tree is the binary tree with minimum external path weight, the one with the minimum sum of weighted path lengths for the given set of leaves. 
So the goal is to build a tree with the minimum external path weight.
